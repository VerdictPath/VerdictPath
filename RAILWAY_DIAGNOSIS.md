# 🔍 Railway Deployment Diagnosis & Fix

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** Railway running FRONTEND instead of BACKEND API

---

## 🚨 Critical Issue Discovered

Railway is currently deploying and running the **WRONG application**!

### What Railway is Running (WRONG):
❌ **Frontend:** Expo/React Native mobile app (from root `package.json`)  
❌ **Start Command:** `expo start` (mobile development server)  
❌ **Result:** Returns HTML, not API responses

### What Railway SHOULD Run (CORRECT):
✅ **Backend:** Express API server (from `backend/package.json`)  
✅ **Start Command:** `node server.js` (in backend directory)  
✅ **Result:** API endpoints at `/api/*`

---

## 🔬 Diagnosis Evidence

### Test 1: Root Endpoint
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/
```

**Result:** Returns React Native/Expo HTML
```html
<title>Verdict Path</title>
<style id="expo-reset">
  html, body { height: 100%; }
```

**Analysis:** ❌ This is the FRONTEND app, not the backend API!

---

### Test 2: API Health Check
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**Result:** 
```html
<pre>Cannot GET /api/health</pre>
```

**Analysis:** ❌ No API endpoints exist because backend isn't running!

---

### Test 3: Diagnostic Endpoint
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

**Result:**
```html
<pre>Cannot GET /api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check</pre>
```

**Analysis:** ❌ Backend routes not loaded - backend server not running!

---

## 🛠️ Root Cause Analysis

### Project Structure:
```
verdict-path/
├── package.json          ← Frontend (Expo) - Railway was using THIS
├── App.js                ← React Native mobile app
├── src/                  ← Frontend screens/components
└── backend/
    ├── package.json      ← Backend (Express) - Railway should use THIS
    ├── server.js         ← Backend entry point
    ├── routes/           ← API endpoints
    └── controllers/      ← Business logic
```

### Why Railway Ran Frontend:

1. **No Build Configuration:** Railway had no explicit instructions
2. **Default Behavior:** Detected root `package.json` first
3. **Assumed Web App:** Ran `npm start` which executes `expo start`
4. **Wrong Port:** Expo serves on port 8081, but Replit proxy expects 5000

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created **4 configuration files** to tell Railway exactly what to run:

### 1. `railway.json` (Railway-Specific Config)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && npm install"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && node server.js"
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Tells Railway to:
- Install dependencies from `backend/package.json`
- Start with `node server.js` from backend directory

---

### 2. `nixpacks.toml` (Nixpacks Build Config)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["cd backend && npm install"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && node server.js"
```

**Purpose:** Alternative build configuration for Railway's Nixpacks builder

---

### 3. `Procfile` (Platform-Agnostic Config)
```
web: cd backend && node server.js
```

**Purpose:** Standard deployment file recognized by Railway and other platforms

---

### 4. `.railwayignore` (Ignore Frontend Files)
```
src/
App.js
app.json
expo/
node_modules/
attached_assets/
!backend/
```

**Purpose:** Tells Railway to ignore frontend files, deploy only backend

---

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Configuration Files ✅
```bash
git add railway.json nixpacks.toml Procfile .railwayignore
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - configure backend server"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Auto-Deploys 🔄
- Railway detects new commit
- Reads `railway.json` or `nixpacks.toml` or `Procfile`
- Runs: `cd backend && npm install`
- Starts: `cd backend && node server.js`
- Backend API now live! 🎉

### Step 3: Verify Deployment ✅
```bash
# Test backend API
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "hasColumn": true,
  "message": "Daily claim protection is active"
}
```

✅ **Success!** Backend is running!

## 🔍 Alternative: Railway Dashboard Configuration

If Railway doesn't pick up the config files, manually configure:

### 1. Go to Railway Dashboard
- Visit https://railway.app
- Open your `verdictpath` project

### 2. Edit Service Settings
- Click on your service
- Go to **Settings** tab

### 3. Set Build Command
Scroll to **Build** section:
```
cd backend && npm install
```

### 4. Set Start Command
Scroll to **Deploy** section:
```
cd backend && node server.js
```

### 5. Set Root Directory (Optional)
If Railway supports it:
```
backend
```

### 6. Redeploy
- Click **Deploy** or trigger new deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Verify with curl tests

## ✅ Post-Fix Verification Checklist

After deployment completes:

- [ ] **Diagnostic Endpoint Works**
  ```bash
  curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
  # Should return JSON
  ```

- [ ] **Auth Endpoint Works**
  ```bash
  curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/auth/check
  # Should return JSON
  ```

- [ ] **Registration Endpoint Works**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/auth/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}'
  # Should return JSON (even if validation error)
  ```

- [ ] **Frontend Can Connect**
  - Open your mobile app
  - Try logging in
  - Should connect to Railway backend
  - Check `src/config/api.js` points to Railway URL

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Broken):
```
User opens app → Frontend calls Railway API
                    ↓
Railway: "I'm serving Expo frontend HTML"
                    ↓
Frontend: "Error: Expected JSON, got HTML"
                    ↓
App doesn't work! ❌
```

### AFTER (Fixed):
```
User opens app → Frontend calls Railway API
                    ↓
Railway: "Here's your JSON data from Express API"
                    ↓
Frontend: "Perfect! Displaying data..."
                    ↓
App works! ✅
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

**Common Monorepo Issue:**

Your project is a **monorepo** with two applications:
1. **Frontend:** Mobile app (Expo/React Native)
2. **Backend:** API server (Express)

Railway saw the root `package.json` and assumed it was a single web app. It didn't know to look in the `backend/` subdirectory.

**Solution:** Explicit configuration files tell Railway:
- "Hey, the app you need to run is in `backend/`"
- "Start it with `node server.js`"
- "Ignore all the frontend stuff"

---

## 📝 Technical Details

### Backend Server Configuration
- **Entry Point:** `backend/server.js`
- **Port:** 5000 (hardcoded for Replit compatibility)
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Node Version:** 18+ (specified in `backend/package.json`)

### API Endpoints (Backend):
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/lawfirm/*` - Law firm portal
- `/api/medicalprovider/*` - Medical provider portal
- `/api/diagnostic/*` - System diagnostics
- `/api/coins/*` - Gamification
- `/api/litigation/*` - Case tracking
- `/portal` - Web portal UI

### Frontend Configuration (NOT for Railway):
- **Framework:** Expo SDK 52
- **Platform:** React Native
- **Package.json:** Root level
- **Runs Locally:** On Replit for development
- **Not Deployed:** Frontend is mobile app, not web server
