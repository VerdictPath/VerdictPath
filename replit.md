# Verdict Path - React Native Mobile App

## Overview
Verdict Path is a React Native mobile application designed as a legal case management and education platform for civil litigation. It provides an interactive case roadmap, gamification elements, educational video tutorials, and secure medical document storage. The platform aims to assist individuals, law firms, and medical providers in navigating legal processes, supported by tiered subscription models. The project's vision is to offer an engaging and informative tool to support justice.

## User Preferences
I want to work with an AI agent that is autonomous and proactive. It should make decisions and implement changes without constant oversight. I prefer that the agent proceed with tasks independently, only seeking clarification if absolutely necessary. I also prefer detailed explanations of the code and the logic behind any changes made.

## System Architecture
The application is a React Native mobile app built with the Expo framework, featuring a "pirate treasure map" theme. The backend is a Node.js/Express server with a PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design is centered on a "pirate treasure map" theme with a warm tan/beige color palette. Key UI/UX elements include an interactive litigation roadmap, a compass/ship wheel logo, pirate-themed badges for gamification, and tailored subscription selection screens. The Medical Hub features distinct upload sections and real-time status tracking. UI elements like audio icons for roadmap substages and descriptive subscription cards are consistently styled to match the theme.

**Roadmap Substage Completion Visual Feedback**:
- "Mark Complete" buttons appear in RED (#e74c3c) for incomplete substages
- After completion, buttons transform to solid GREEN (#27ae60) displaying "‚úì Completed" in white text
- Clear visual distinction helps users quickly identify their progress
- UI state properly syncs with backend completion status

**Audio Icons Enhancement**:
- Audio icons (üéß) in roadmap substages feature solid blue background (#3498db) for high visibility

### Technical Implementations
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 52 with React Native 0.76.9.
- **Project Structure**: Modular, organized into `src/screens/` and `src/components/`. Monorepo structure with frontend at root and backend in `backend/` subdirectory.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (port 5000) with PostgreSQL for user authentication, client management, litigation tracking, and HIPAA-compliant data handling.
- **Deployment**: Railway deployment configured via `railway.json`, `nixpacks.toml`, and `Procfile` to ensure backend server runs correctly. Frontend (Expo) is for local development only; Railway deploys backend API.
- **HIPAA Security**: Implements AES-256-GCM encryption for PHI at rest, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with 6 roles and 23 granular permissions, Patient Consent Management, comprehensive audit logging, and account security measures.
- **Litigation Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive backend integration for tracking user progress through a 9-stage litigation journey with 60 substages, including database tables, API endpoints, automatic coin rewards, and real-time progress display.
- **Client/Patient Management**: Includes real-time search functionality by name or email, restructured portals with tab-based navigation (Overview, Roadmap, Medical Hub, Evidence Locker) for individual client/patient details, and robust connection management for users.
- **Connection Management**: ONLY individual users (userType: 'individual' or 'client') can manage connections with law firms or medical providers. Law firms and medical providers are completely blocked from using connection features. Individual users can:
  - Connect with ONE law firm at a time via connection code
  - Connect with MULTIPLE medical providers simultaneously via connection codes (no limit)
  - Disconnect from their current law firm (sets law_firm_code to NULL, removes law_firm_clients relationship)
  - Remove specific medical providers by ID from their list of connections
  - Switch to a different law firm (automatically removes old relationship before creating new one)
  - Add additional medical providers to their existing list without replacing previous connections
  - Backend enforces 403 Forbidden for non-individual users on all connection endpoints
  - Endpoints: POST /connections/update-lawfirm, POST /connections/add-medical-provider, POST /connections/disconnect-lawfirm, POST /connections/remove-medical-provider
  - GET /connections/my-connections returns lawFirm (single object) and medicalProviders (array)
  - Medical provider connections stored in medical_provider_patients junction table
  - All connection operations prevent orphaned database relationships and maintain data integrity
- **Subscription Management**: Implements a complete system for individual, law firm, and medical provider subscriptions with Free, Basic, and Premium tiers. This includes automatic unique code generation, free trial limits, expanded law firm and medical provider size tiers, and a full upgrade/downgrade protocol with validation.
- **Gamification Logic**: Coin system for milestones and daily streaks with a fraud-prevented coin-to-credit conversion (lifetime cap of $5 credit).
- **Universal Invite/Referral System**: Allows all user types to generate unique invite codes, with coin rewards for individual users whose invitees sign up.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Extensive support for iOS, Android, mobile web, and desktop web.
- **Phase 2: Smart Notifications & Attorney-Controlled Action Dashboard** (October 2025):
  - **Push Notification System**: Law firms and medical providers can send targeted push notifications to connected clients/patients with 16 professional templates, multi-recipient selection, scheduling capabilities, and comprehensive analytics tracking (sent, delivered, clicked rates).
  - **Attorney-Assigned Task System**: Law firms create actionable tasks for clients through LawFirmSendNotificationScreen with optional task assignment. Tasks include titles, descriptions, priorities (urgent/high/medium/low), due dates, and coin rewards. Individual users access tasks via ActionDashboardScreen with filtering by status/priority, pull-to-refresh, and tap-to-update functionality.
  - **Notification Templates**: 10 law firm templates (court_reminder, deposition_notice, document_request, settlement_update, case_milestone, deadline_reminder, appointment_confirmation, task_reminder, status_update, general_communication) and 6 medical provider templates (appointment_reminder, test_results, prescription_ready, billing_notice, health_tip, general_update).
  - **Security & Compliance**: Zero AI-generated legal advice - all task content controlled by attorneys. Law firms can only create tasks for connected clients (verified via law_firm_clients junction table). Task audit logging tracks all status changes.
  - **Database Schema**: New tables include push_notifications, push_devices, notification_analytics, notification_templates, law_firm_tasks, medical_provider_tasks, task_templates, and task_audit.
  - **API Integration**: Centralized API configuration in src/config/api.js with Railway backend URL. All API calls use apiRequest helper with proper error handling and authentication headers.
