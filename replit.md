# Verdict Path - React Native Mobile App

## Overview
Verdict Path is a React Native mobile application designed as a legal case management and education platform for civil litigation. It offers an interactive case roadmap, gamification, educational content, and secure medical document storage. The platform aims to assist individuals, law firms, and medical providers in navigating legal processes, supported by tiered subscription models, to provide an engaging and informative tool to support justice. The business vision is to empower users with legal knowledge and streamline case management.

## User Preferences
I want to work with an AI agent that is autonomous and proactive. It should make decisions and implement changes without constant oversight. I prefer that the agent proceed with tasks independently, only seeking clarification if absolutely necessary. I also prefer detailed explanations of the code and the logic behind any changes made.

## System Architecture
The application is a React Native mobile app built with the Expo framework, featuring a "pirate treasure map" theme. The backend is a Node.js/Express server with a PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design uses a "pirate treasure map" theme with a warm tan/beige color palette. Key elements include an interactive litigation roadmap, a compass/ship wheel logo, pirate-themed badges for gamification, and tailored subscription selection screens. The Medical Hub features distinct upload sections and "Coming Soon" messages for all upload functionalities. Visual feedback, enhanced audio icons, and a 6-slide pirate-themed onboarding are implemented. Progress tracking includes an animated progress bar. A sticky 5-tab bottom navigation is present for individual users, with an "Actions" tab for attorney-assigned tasks. Law Firm and Medical Provider portals have dedicated functionalities like notification systems and analytics dashboards.

### Technical Implementations
The application uses Expo SDK 52 with React Native 0.76.9 in a modular monorepo structure. The backend is Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL, deployed via Railway, implementing HIPAA-compliant security with AES-256-GCM encryption, RBAC, patient consent management, and audit logging. The system tracks litigation progress through 9 stages and 60 substages, includes client/patient management with real-time search, and a comprehensive connection management system. A subscription management system supports Free, Basic, and Premium tiers. Gamification includes a coin system with a 25,000-coin cap and a universal invite/referral system. Cross-platform compatibility is supported.
