## User Preferences
I want to work with an AI agent that is autonomous and proactive. It should make decisions and implement changes without constant oversight. I prefer that the agent proceed with tasks independently, only seeking clarification if absolutely necessary. I also prefer detailed explanations of the code and the logic behind any changes made.

## System Architecture
The application is a React Native mobile application built with the Expo framework.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Thematic Design**: The core UI/UX is built around a "pirate treasure map" theme, featuring treasure chests for stages, a parchment-like background, and pirate-themed avatars.
- **Logo Integration**: The Verdict Path logo is seamlessly integrated with a matching background color (`#f5f5f5`) for a clean, professional appearance.
- **Interactive Roadmap**: The litigation roadmap is transformed into an interactive treasure map, where each stage is represented by a positioned treasure chest. Clicking a treasure chest opens a modal with stage details, progress tracking, sub-stages, and integrated tutorial videos.
- **Animated Progress**: Animated green winding paths connect completed stages to the next, using S-curve designs and Bezier curves for a natural, flowing animation.
- **Subscription Selection**: A dedicated screen within the registration flow presents tiered subscription options based on user type (Individual, Law Firm, Medical Provider) and organization size.
- **Medical Hub UI**: Features distinct upload sections for Medical Bills and Medical Records with "Take Photo" or "Choose Files" options, real-time status tracking, and file viewing.
- **Data Entry UI**: Text-based tasks in the Pre-Litigation stage use a purple "‚úèÔ∏è Enter Information" button, displaying saved information with an "Edit Information" option.

### Technical Implementations
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 52 with React Native 0.76.9.
- **Project Structure**: Organized into `src/screens/`, `src/components/`, `src/utils/`, `src/constants/`, and `src/styles/` for modularity.
- **Gamification Logic**: Implements a coin system for completing milestones, daily login streaks, and coin-to-credit conversion, managed by utility functions.
- **Document Management**: Features robust document upload functionality with multi-file support, specific file type filters, and integration with the Medical Hub for validation.
- **State Management**: Centralized in `App.js` and passed via props.
- **Styling**: Uses shared common styles and screen-specific styles.
- **Image Processing**: Python/Pillow was used for logo background integration to remove artifacts.
- **SVG Animation**: Utilizes `react-native-svg` with cubic Bezier curves for animated path rendering.

### Feature Specifications
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, logout (mock implementation).
- **User Types & Subscriptions**: Supports Individual, Law Firm, and Medical Provider user types with Free, Basic, and Premium subscription tiers, including dynamic, size-based pricing for organizations.
