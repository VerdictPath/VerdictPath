# Verdict Path - React Native Mobile App

## Overview
Verdict Path is a React Native mobile application designed as a legal case management and education platform for civil litigation. It offers an interactive case roadmap, gamification, educational content, and secure medical document storage. The platform aims to assist individuals, law firms, and medical providers in navigating legal processes, supported by tiered subscription models, to provide an engaging and informative tool to support justice. The business vision is to empower users with legal knowledge and streamline case management.

## User Preferences
I want to work with an AI agent that is autonomous and proactive. It should make decisions and implement changes without constant oversight. I prefer that the agent proceed with tasks independently, only seeking clarification if absolutely necessary. I also prefer detailed explanations of the code and the logic behind any changes made.

## Recent Changes (November 21, 2025)
- **Fixed Law Firm User Creation Hanging Bug**: Added connection timeouts (5 seconds) to email service (nodemailer) to prevent indefinite hanging when SMTP credentials are not configured or server is unreachable. Added early return if SMTP credentials are missing.
- **Required Phone Number for Individual Registration**: Added required `phoneNumber` field to individual user registration form with frontend validation and backend database integration. Phone number is now stored in the `phone_number` column of the `users` table.
- **Law Firm Bottom Navigation Menu**: Created new `LawFirmBottomNavigation` component with sticky bottom menu featuring 5 tabs: Dashboard (📊), Notifications (🔔), Users (👥), Disbursements (💰), and Negotiations (🤝). Navigation uses law firm theme colors (navy #1e3a5f with gold #d4af37 accents) and matches existing screens: lawfirm-dashboard, lawfirm-send-notification, lawfirm-user-management, lawfirm-disbursements, lawfirm-negotiations.

## System Architecture
The application is a React Native mobile app built with the Expo framework, featuring a "pirate treasure map" theme. The backend is a Node.js/Express server with a PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design uses a "pirate treasure map" theme with a warm tan/beige color palette. Key elements include an interactive litigation roadmap with a vintage treasure map background (featuring compass rose, skull island, "Starting Point", "Cave of Wonders", and "X marks the treasure"), a realistic treasure chest icon (pirate chest with gold coins on ship deck), pirate-themed badges for gamification, tailored subscription selection screens, and custom pirate-themed images. The Medical Hub features distinct upload sections and "Coming Soon" messages. Visual feedback, enhanced audio icons, and onboarding removed (direct to landing page). Progress tracking includes an animated progress bar with raining gold coins celebration video (11.1 MB) when individual users complete roadmap tasks. A sticky 5-tab bottom navigation is present for individual users, with an "Actions" tab for attorney-assigned tasks. Law Firm and Medical Provider portals have dedicated functionalities like notification systems and analytics dashboards. A new nautical pirate logo with a foggy sea background is used system-wide, featuring a feathered edge effect on the landing page that blends seamlessly with the video background using MaskedView and radial SVG gradient (20% feather amount).

### Technical Implementations
The application uses Expo SDK 52 with React Native 0.76.9 in a modular monorepo structure. The backend is Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL, deployed via Railway, implementing HIPAA-compliant security with AES-256-GCM encryption, RBAC, patient consent management, and audit logging. The system tracks litigation progress through 9 stages and 60 substages, includes client/patient management with real-time search, and a comprehensive connection management system. A subscription management system supports Free, Basic, and Premium tiers. Gamification includes a coin system with a 25,000-coin cap and a universal invite/referral system. Cross-platform compatibility is supported, including web deployment with mobile-only features disabled for web. Real-time coin balance updates are implemented.

Key technical features include:
- **Avatar Video System (Individual Users Only)**: 100% COMPLETE - Comprehensive avatar system with 4 legal-themed characters (The Advocate, Lady Justice, The Paralegal, The Judge). All 12 videos (8 calm background loops + 4 action celebrations) and 4 thumbnails fully integrated (~47MB total assets). Features looping background videos on dashboard, celebratory action videos with coin rewards (substage completion, stage completion, daily bonus), dynamic theming based on selected avatar (4 unique color schemes), long-press preview on selection screen, and 6.5s auto-close action modals. Restricted to individual users only via backend validation and frontend conditional rendering - law firms and medical providers receive 403 errors if attempting access. Avatar database IDs preserved for compatibility (captain→Advocate, navigator→Lady Justice, strategist→Paralegal, advocate→Judge).
- **Bidirectional Connection System**: Complete connection management system allowing law firms to connect with medical providers and vice versa. Law firms can add/remove medical providers via connection codes, medical providers can add/remove law firms, and individual users can connect with both law firms and medical providers. Uses medical_provider_law_firms junction table with soft-delete (connection_status: active/disconnected).
- **Bill Negotiations Portal**: Full-featured negotiation system for law firms and medical providers to negotiate medical bills, including initiation, counter-offers, acceptance, and negotiation history.
- **Client-Medical Provider Relationship Management**: Secure system for tracking client-medical provider relationships, controlled by law firms.
- **Premium Access Control for Settlement Disbursements**: Gating of settlement disbursement features for premium law firm subscribers.
- **Push Notification System**: Targeted notifications, 22 templates, Expo push integration, deep linking, real-time badge count synchronization, client-specific analytics with filtering, and real-time client search in send notification screen.
- **Attorney-Assigned Task System**: Law firms create tasks for clients with priorities, due dates, and coin rewards. Individual users can view, complete, and revert tasks via Action Dashboard. Task reversion preserves coins (anti-farming mechanism) and prevents duplicate coin awards on re-completion.
- **Calendar Integration**: Full device calendar sync via Expo Calendar API.
- **Enhanced Gamification**: 16 achievements, 8 pirate-themed badges with rarity, progress tracking, and a leaderboard system.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Full Stripe payment processing for subscriptions and one-time payments, supporting Apple Pay and Google Pay, including a Coin Purchase System.
- **Settlement Disbursement System**: Law firm portal feature for tracking settlement disbursements, including Stripe Connect for account onboarding and payment processing.
- **Multi-User Law Firm Accounts**: Complete role-based permission system for law firms. Auto-provisions admin user during registration, supports role hierarchy (admin/attorney/staff), granular permissions (can_manage_users, can_manage_clients, can_view_all_clients, can_send_notifications, can_manage_disbursements, can_view_analytics, can_manage_settings), user limits based on subscription tier, and full CRUD operations (create, list, update, deactivate, reactivate). Includes bootstrap fallback logic for legacy firms, audit logging for all user management actions, and comprehensive authentication middleware with permission checking utilities. Features signed cookie support for browser sessions with triple-layer authentication (Bearer tokens, signed cookies, regular cookies).
- **Activity Tracking System**: Comprehensive activity logging for law firms with enable_activity_tracking enabled. Tracks 28 action types across 8 categories (user, client, document, financial, communication, case, settings, security). Provides activity logs, statistics, most active users analytics, and failed activity monitoring. All user actions (login, user management, client operations) are automatically logged with full context including IP address, user agent, and metadata. Features clean middleware wrapper pattern (`logActivity(action, category)`) for automatic activity logging on routes with response interception, context extraction, and sensitive data sanitization.
- **Multi-User Medical Provider Accounts with HIPAA Compliance**: Complete role-based permission system achieving full parity with law firm architecture. Auto-provisions admin user during registration, supports role hierarchy (admin/physician/nurse/staff/billing), granular permissions (10 total including can_access_phi, can_view_medical_records, can_edit_medical_records), and full CRUD operations (create, list, update, deactivate, reactivate). Enhanced with comprehensive HIPAA compliance features: automatic sensitivity level assignment (critical/high/medium/low), patient access auditing with detailed tracking, HIPAA training date/expiry validation with automatic blocking, 7-year data retention compliance, patient-specific audit trails, HIPAA compliance report endpoint (admin-only) showing compliance rate, training status, and critical activities, and patient access audit endpoint tracking who accessed which patient records with PHI access logging. All 25 medical providers migrated with admin users. Complete authentication middleware with JWT verification, bootstrap scenario support (synthetic user ID -1 for first-time logins with admin stub), and triple-layer token extraction (Bearer tokens, signed cookies, regular cookies). Activity logging with HIPAA fields (sensitivity_level, patient_id, patient_name, hipaa_compliant, audit_required). Features 5 database indexes for performance and PostgreSQL function for training validation. Full integration test coverage confirming parity with law firm portal.
