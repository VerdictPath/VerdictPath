## üåê EASIEST ALTERNATIVE: Deploy a Database UI Tool

If the above don't work, you can deploy a free database management tool:

### Option A: Deploy Adminer (Recommended)

1. **Go to Railway Template**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/template/Pcgkm8

2. **Click "Deploy"**
   - Login with your Railway account
   - Select your existing project (Verdict Path)

3. **Configure the Connection**
   - Railway will ask for `DATABASE_URL`
   - Copy your PostgreSQL's `DATABASE_URL` from your database service's Variables tab
   - Paste it when prompted

4. **Access Adminer**
   - Railway will generate a URL (like `adminer-production.up.railway.app`)
   - Click it to open Adminer

5. **Run the SQL**
   - In Adminer, click "SQL command"
   - Paste:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_daily_claim_at TIMESTAMP;
   ```
   - Click "Execute"
