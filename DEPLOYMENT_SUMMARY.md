## üö® Problem: Changes Not Live on Railway

**Your frontend calls Railway backend:** `https://verdictpath.up.railway.app`

**Railway is still running old code from days ago!**

**Proof:**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
# Returns: "Cannot GET /api/diagnostic..." (404 error)
# Should return: {"hasColumn":true,"message":"Daily claim protection is active"}
```

## üéØ How to Deploy to Railway (Choose One Method)

### ‚≠ê METHOD 1: GitHub Push (RECOMMENDED)

This is the fastest if Railway is already connected to GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Commit your changes (Replit auto-commits at session end, or manually:)
git add .
git commit -m "Update subscriptions: remove trial labels, add features, fix patient counts"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Railway will auto-deploy (if connected to GitHub)
# - Go to https://railway.app
# - Watch "Deployments" tab
# - Wait for "Success" status (2-3 minutes)
```

**Then test:**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

‚úÖ If you see JSON response = SUCCESS!  
‚ùå If you see "Cannot GET" = Railway didn't update

---

### üîÑ METHOD 2: Reconnect GitHub (If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Work)

Sometimes Railway gets "stuck" and won't auto-deploy. Force it:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app
2. **Open your `verdictpath` project**
3. **Click on your backend service**
4. **Go to Settings tab**
5. **Scroll to "Source" section**
6. **Click "Disconnect"**
7. **Click "Connect Repo"**
8. **Select your GitHub repository**
9. **Railway immediately starts fresh deployment**
10. **Wait 2-3 minutes for "Success"**

**Then test the diagnostic endpoint again.**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è METHOD 3: Railway CLI (Manual Deployment)

If you want direct control:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to project
railway link
# (Select 'verdictpath' from the list)

# Deploy current code
railway up
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Verify Deployment Worked

After Railway deploys, test everything:

### 1. **Backend Diagnostic Check**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```
**Expected:** JSON response with `"hasColumn":true`

### 2. **Test Registration** (Use Browser)
- Navigate to your app's registration
- Try registering as Individual
- Verify first/last name fields appear
- Verify names are required

### 3. **Test Law Firm Subscriptions**
- Go to Law Firm registration
- Check Free tier says "Free" (not "Free Trial")
- Check Basic tier shows:
  - "Client roadmap access"
  - "Evidence Locker"
- Check Premium tier shows:
  - "Medical Hub (COMING SOON)"
  - "HIPAA-Compliant Storage (COMING SOON)"

### 4. **Test Medical Provider Subscriptions**
- Go to Medical Provider registration
- Check Free tier says "Free" (not "Free Trial")
- Select "Medium Practice" organizational size
- Verify Basic card shows "101-500 patients"
- Verify Premium card shows "101-500 patients"

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### "Git push fails"
```bash
# Pull latest first
git pull origin main

# Then push
git push origin main
```

### "Railway shows old code"
1. Check deployment status in Railway dashboard
2. Look at deployment logs for errors
3. Try Method 2 (Reconnect GitHub)

### "Changes don't appear in browser"
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify Railway deployment succeeded

## üìä Current Status

| Component | Status | Action Needed |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Local Code | ‚úÖ All changes complete | None |
| Git Commits | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | Auto-commits at session end |
| GitHub Push | ‚ùå Not pushed yet | `git push origin main` |
| Railway Deploy | üö® Running OLD code | Deploy via Method 1, 2, or 3 |

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Deployment

**Fastest way to deploy right now:**

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 2. Go to Railway dashboard and wait for auto-deploy
# https://railway.app

# 3. Test it worked
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

**If that doesn't work, use Method 2 (Reconnect GitHub).**

## üí° Why This Happened

- Replit auto-commits happen at **session end**
- Your changes are saved locally but **not pushed to GitHub yet**
- Railway can only deploy what's **on GitHub**
- Until you push to GitHub, Railway keeps running the old code

**Solution:** Push your commits to GitHub, and Railway will auto-deploy! üéâ
