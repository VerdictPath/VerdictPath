# Daily Rewards Security Diagnostic

## Issue
User reports being able to claim daily rewards infinitely on Railway production environment.

## Root Cause
The `last_daily_claim_at` column was only added to the local development database, **NOT** the Railway production database.

## Fix Required
Run the SQL in `RAILWAY_DATABASE_FIX.sql` on your Railway PostgreSQL database.

## How to Apply the Fix to Railway

### Option 1: Using Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your PostgreSQL database service
3. Click on the "Query" tab
4. Paste and run this SQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_daily_claim_at TIMESTAMP;
```
5. Verify it worked:
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'last_daily_claim_at';
```

### Option 2: Using Railway CLI
```bash
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_daily_claim_at TIMESTAMP;"
```

## Security Verification

After applying the fix, test with these steps:

1. **First Claim (Should Succeed)**
   - Login to your app
   - Click "Claim Daily Bonus"
   - You should receive coins and see success message

2. **Second Claim (Should FAIL)**
   - Immediately click "Claim Daily Bonus" again
   - You should see: "Already Claimed - You have already claimed your daily reward today. Come back tomorrow!"
   - Your coin balance should NOT increase

## Code Security Review

### âœ… Secure Elements:
1. **Date Normalization** (line 342): Strips time component for accurate day comparison
2. **Duplicate Prevention** (lines 349-357): Rejects if already claimed today
3. **Atomic Transaction** (lines 322, 405): BEGIN...COMMIT ensures consistency
4. **Timestamp Update** (line 383): Records exact claim time
5. **Audit Logging** (lines 389-403): Full accountability trail

### âœ… No Bypass Vectors:
- `/api/coins/update` endpoint removed completely
- All coin awards server-validated
- Client cannot manipulate timestamps
- Transaction rollback on any error

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Scenario 1: First claim of the day**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bonus": 5,
  "newStreak": 1,
  "totalCoins": 105,
  "message": "Daily bonus claimed! You earned 5 coins! 1 day streak! ðŸŽ‰"
}
```

**Scenario 2: Attempting second claim same day**
```json
{
  "message": "Daily reward already claimed today",
  "alreadyClaimed": true,
  "currentStreak": 1
}
```

## Monitoring

After deploying the fix, monitor for:
- Abnormal coin spikes in `users.total_coins`
- Multiple `DAILY_REWARD_CLAIMED` audit logs per user per day
- Error rates on `/api/coins/claim-daily` endpoint

## Confirmation Checklist

- [ ] SQL executed on Railway database
- [ ] Column exists in Railway database (verified with query)
- [ ] Backend service restarted (if needed)
- [ ] Tested first claim - succeeds with coins awarded
- [ ] Tested second claim - fails with "already claimed" error
- [ ] Verified coins do NOT increase on second attempt
- [ ] Checked audit logs show only one claim per day per user
