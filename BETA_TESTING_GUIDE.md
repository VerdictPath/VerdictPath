## 📋 Phase 5: Real-World Simulation (Anonymous Testing)

**Goal:** Test the app as it would be used in the real world, without knowing who your collaborators are

### How It Works
- You'll be assigned a testing partner (or partners)
- You will **NOT** know who they are
- You'll only interact through the VerdictPath platform
- This simulates real-world usage where users don't know each other beforehand

### Your Assignment
**You will receive:**
- Your portal role (Individual, Law Firm, or Provider)
- A case scenario to work through
- Specific tasks to complete
- No information about who you're working with

### Example Scenarios

#### If you're assigned as an Individual:
- Create a case for a car accident injury
- Connect with an assigned law firm (you'll receive their firm name)
- Request records from an assigned provider
- Communicate only through the platform

#### If you're assigned as a Law Firm:
- Accept an incoming case from an unknown individual
- Request medical records from an assigned provider
- Manage the case using only the information in the platform

#### If you're assigned as a Medical Provider:
- Respond to record requests
- Provide medical documentation
- Communicate only through secure platform channels

### What We're Testing
- 🔐 **Privacy:** Does the platform maintain appropriate boundaries?
- 💬 **Communication:** Can users collaborate effectively without outside contact?
- 🎭 **User Experience:** Does the platform provide enough context?
- 🚀 **Workflow:** Can a case be managed entirely within the platform?
