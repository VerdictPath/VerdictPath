# üîß Railway Manual Fix - Step-by-Step

**Status:** Config files pushed to GitHub, but Railway hasn't redeployed  
**Action:** Manual Railway dashboard configuration required

---

## üö® Current Situation

‚úÖ **Configuration files created and pushed to GitHub:**
- `railway.json`
- `nixpacks.toml`
- `Procfile`
- `.railwayignore`

‚ùå **Railway is STILL serving the Expo frontend:**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/
# Returns: Expo HTML with <style id="expo-reset">
```

‚ùå **API endpoints still return 404:**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
# Returns: "Cannot GET /api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check"
```

**Railway hasn't picked up the config files automatically.**

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Manual Railway Configuration

Follow these exact steps to fix Railway:

---

### **Step 1: Open Railway Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Log in with your account
3. Click on your **`verdictpath`** project

---

### **Step 2: Find Your Service**

You should see a service/deployment card. Click on it.

*(If you see multiple services, click on the one that's currently deployed)*

---

### **Step 3: Check Settings Tab**

1. Click the **"Settings"** tab at the top
2. Scroll down to find these sections:
   - **Source** (GitHub connection)
   - **Build** settings
   - **Deploy** settings

---

### **Step 4: Configure Build Settings**

Scroll to the **"Build"** section:

**Option A: Set Build Command**
- Click **"Custom Build Command"** or find the build command field
- Enter exactly:
  ```
  cd backend && npm install
  ```
- Click **Save** or press Enter

**Option B: Set Root Directory (if available)**
- Look for "Root Directory" field
- Enter:
  ```
  backend
  ```
- If this works, you can use just `npm install` as build command

---

### **Step 5: Configure Start Command** ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT

Scroll to the **"Deploy"** section:

**Find the Start Command field** (might be labeled "Custom Start Command" or just "Start Command")

**Enter exactly:**
```
cd backend && node server.js
```

**OR if you set Root Directory to `backend`:**
```
node server.js
```

**Click Save**

---

### **Step 6: Trigger Redeploy**

Now force Railway to redeploy:

**Method A: Use "Redeploy" Button**
1. Go back to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **three dots (...)** menu
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

**Method B: Disconnect & Reconnect GitHub**
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Source"** section
3. Click **"Disconnect"**
4. Click **"Connect Repo"**
5. Select your repository
6. Railway will immediately start deploying

---

### **Step 7: Monitor Deployment**

1. Stay on the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Watch the build logs in real-time
3. Look for these success indicators:
   ```
   ‚úì Building...
   ‚úì cd backend && npm install
   ‚úì Deploying...
   ‚úì Starting: cd backend && node server.js
   ‚úì VerdictPath Backend Server running on port 5000
   ```

4. Wait for **"Success"** or **"Active"** status

---

### **Step 8: Verify It Worked**

After Railway shows "Success", test immediately:

**Test 1: Diagnostic Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

‚úÖ **SUCCESS if you see:**
```json
{"hasColumn":true,"message":"Daily claim protection is active"}
```

‚ùå **STILL BROKEN if you see:**
```html
<pre>Cannot GET /api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check</pre>
```

**Test 2: Root Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/ | grep -i expo
```

‚úÖ **SUCCESS if:** No "expo" text appears  
‚ùå **STILL BROKEN if:** You see "expo-reset" or Expo-related HTML

---

## üîß Alternative: Environment Variables

If the above doesn't work, try setting environment variables:

1. Go to **"Variables"** tab in Railway
2. Add this variable:
   - **Name:** `RAILWAY_RUN_COMMAND`
   - **Value:** `cd backend && node server.js`
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Build fails
**Check build logs for errors:**
- Missing `backend/package.json`? (Should be there)
- npm install errors? (Check dependencies)

**Solution:** Make sure your GitHub repo has the `backend/` directory with `package.json`

---

### Problem: Deployment succeeds but still shows Expo
**Possible causes:**
1. Railway cached old build
2. Start command not applied
3. Multiple services deployed

**Solution:**
1. Try "Redeploy" again
2. Check **"Deployments"** tab - is there more than one active deployment?
3. If multiple, stop/delete the old one serving Expo

---

### Problem: API works but returns wrong data
**This means backend is running but with old code**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure your latest GitHub commit includes subscription changes
2. Check Railway is deploying from `main` branch
3. Verify Railway pulled latest commit (check deployment SHA)

---

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before you start:
- [ ] Logged into Railway dashboard
- [ ] Found your `verdictpath` project
- [ ] Have the project open

During configuration:
- [ ] Set build command: `cd backend && npm install`
- [ ] Set start command: `cd backend && node server.js`
- [ ] Triggered redeploy (disconnected/reconnected or clicked redeploy)
- [ ] Watched deployment logs

After deployment:
- [ ] Tested diagnostic endpoint (returns JSON)
- [ ] Tested root endpoint (no Expo HTML)
- [ ] Verified subscription changes appear in frontend

---

## üéØ What Should Happen

**Correct Railway Deployment:**

1. Railway pulls latest code from GitHub
2. Railway reads `railway.json` OR uses your manual settings
3. Railway runs: `cd backend && npm install`
4. Railway starts: `cd backend && node server.js`
5. Backend server starts on port from `process.env.PORT`
6. API endpoints become available at `/api/*`
7. Your frontend can now connect to the backend

---

## üìû If Nothing Works

### Last Resort: Create New Railway Service

1. In Railway dashboard, create **"New Service"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository
4. **IMMEDIATELY configure before first deploy:**
   - Build Command: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Start Command: `cd backend && node server.js`
5. Deploy
6. Once working, delete the old service
7. Update your frontend API URL if domain changed

---

## üìä Expected Results

After successful deployment:

| Endpoint | Before (Wrong) | After (Correct) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `/` | Expo HTML | Expo app served by Express |
| `/api/auth/check` | 404 Error | JSON response |
| `/api/diagnostic/...` | 404 Error | JSON with data |
| `/portal` | 404 Error | Law firm login page |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Fix

Once Railway is running the backend correctly:

1. ‚úÖ Test all API endpoints
2. ‚úÖ Open your mobile app and try logging in
3. ‚úÖ Verify subscription changes appear
4. ‚úÖ Test registration with new name fields
5. ‚úÖ Verify medical provider patient counts display correctly
