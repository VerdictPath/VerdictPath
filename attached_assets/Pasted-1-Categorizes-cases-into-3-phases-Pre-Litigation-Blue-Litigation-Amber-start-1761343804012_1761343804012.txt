1. Categorizes cases into 3 phases:
   - Pre-Litigation (Blue üìã)
   - Litigation (Amber ‚öñÔ∏è) - starts when "File Complaint" task (cf-1) is completed
   - Trial (Red üèõÔ∏è) - starts when "Pre-Trial Preparation" task (trial-1) is completed

2. Shows analytics dashboards for:
   - Law firms: see all clients categorized by phase with progress bars
   - Medical providers: see all patients categorized by phase
   - Individual users: see current phase indicator on roadmap with celebration alerts at milestones

3. Technical implementation:
   - Update mockData.js to add phase properties to all stages/substages
   - Create analyticsTracker.js utility to detect phase transitions
   - Update RoadmapScreen to show phase indicator and track completions
   - Update LawFirmDashboardScreen with analytics (client count by phase, progress bars)
   - Update MedicalProviderDashboardScreen with analytics (patient count by phase)
   - Update API config with analytics endpoints

4. Backend needs:
   - Database: clients.current_phase column, completed_substages table
   - API endpoints: POST complete-substage, GET analytics for clients/firms/providers
   - Logic to detect cf-1 and trial-1 completions and update phase

5. Critical bug fix:
   - App.js line 3 must import Alert from react-native (not custom alert)

Please create:
- Updated mockData.js with CASE_PHASE constants and phase properties
- New analyticsTracker.js with phase detection and tracking functions
- Updated RoadmapScreen.jsx with phase indicator and celebration alerts
- Updated LawFirmDashboardScreen.jsx with phase analytics and progress bars
- Updated MedicalProviderDashboardScreen.jsx with phase analytics
- Updated api.js config with analytics endpoints
- Implementation guide with backend requirements
- Testing procedures

The system should automatically detect when users complete key milestones and show celebrations, while law firms and medical providers get real-time visibility into which clients/patients are in litigation or heading to trial.
