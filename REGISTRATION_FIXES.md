# Registration Bug Fixes - October 29, 2025

## Summary
Fixed **5 major registration bugs** that prevented proper user account creation and made the app use auto-generated names instead of real user names.

---

## Bugs Fixed

### üêõ Bug #1: Paid Tier Registration Didn't Work
**Issue:** When users selected Basic or Premium subscription tiers, the app only showed an alert and redirected to login WITHOUT creating their account.

**Location:** `App.js` lines 227-232 (old code)

**Fix:** Implemented full paid tier registration flow that:
- Creates the account immediately with the selected tier
- Sets user data and logs them in
- Shows welcome message explaining payment would occur in production
- Redirects to appropriate dashboard

---

### üêõ Bug #2: No Name Input for Individual Users  
**Issue:** Individual users couldn't enter their first/last names. App auto-generated names using `email.split('@')[0]` as first name and 'User' as last name.

**Example:**
- Email: `john@example.com`
- Auto-generated: First Name = "john", Last Name = "User"

**Fix:** 
- Added `firstName` and `lastName` input fields to RegisterScreen
- Added validation to require both fields
- Updated registration API to use actual user-provided names

---

### üêõ Bug #3: No Name Input for Law Firms
**Issue:** Law firms couldn't enter their firm name. App auto-generated using `email.split('@')[0] + ' Law Firm'`.

**Example:**
- Email: `contact@smithlaw.com`
- Auto-generated: Firm Name = "contact Law Firm"

**Fix:**
- Added `firmName` input field to RegisterScreen
- Added validation to require firm name
- Updated registration API to use actual firm name

---

### üêõ Bug #4: No Name Input for Medical Providers
**Issue:** Medical providers couldn't enter their practice name. App auto-generated using `email.split('@')[0] + ' Medical Center'`.

**Example:**
- Email: `admin@healthclinic.com`
- Auto-generated: Provider Name = "admin Medical Center"

**Fix:**
- Added `providerName` input field to RegisterScreen  
- Added validation to require provider name
- Updated registration API to use actual provider name

---

### üêõ Bug #5: Invite Code Errors Failed Silently
**Issue:** When users entered invalid invite codes, the error was logged to console but users saw no feedback. They didn't know if the code worked or not.

**Fix:**
- Added error handling that shows alert with clear message
- Invite code errors don't block registration (account still created)
- Success feedback shows when invite code is valid
- Clear messaging: "‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid invite code: [error]. Your account was still created successfully."

---

## Files Changed

### 1. `src/screens/RegisterScreen.js`
- Added new props: `firstName`, `setFirstName`, `lastName`, `setLastName`, `firmName`, `setFirmName`, `providerName`, `setProviderName`
- Added conditional name input fields based on user type:
  - Individual users see: First Name + Last Name fields
  - Law firms see: Law Firm Name field
  - Medical providers see: Medical Provider/Practice Name field

### 2. `App.js`
- Added state variables for names (lines 38-41):
  ```javascript
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
  const [firmName, setFirmName] = useState('');
  const [providerName, setProviderName] = useState('');
  ```

- Updated `handleRegister()` validation (lines 68-82):
  - Validates required name fields based on user type
  - Shows clear error messages

- Updated registration API calls (lines 128, 155, 184-185):
  - Removed `email.split('@')[0]` logic
  - Use actual user-provided names

- Fixed paid tier registration (lines 250-347):
  - Creates account with paid tier
  - Sets user data and logs in
  - Shows welcome message

- Improved invite code handling (lines 208-227):
  - Shows error alerts for invalid codes
  - Provides success feedback for valid codes
  - Doesn't block registration on invite errors

## Technical Details

### Name Validation Logic
```javascript
// Individual users
if (userType === USER_TYPES.INDIVIDUAL && (!firstName || !lastName)) {
  alert('Error: Please enter your first and last name');
  return;
}

// Law firms
if (userType === USER_TYPES.LAW_FIRM && !firmName) {
  alert('Error: Please enter your law firm name');
  return;
}

// Medical providers
if (userType === USER_TYPES.MEDICAL_PROVIDER && !providerName) {
  alert('Error: Please enter your medical provider/practice name');
  return;
}
```

### Paid Tier Registration Flow
1. User selects Basic or Premium tier
2. System creates account with selected tier
3. Sets subscription price based on tier (Basic: $9.99, Premium: $19.99)
4. Logs user in immediately
5. Shows welcome message explaining payment would occur in production
6. Redirects to appropriate dashboard

### Invite Code Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  // Process invite code
  const inviteResponse = await apiRequest(API_ENDPOINTS.INVITES.PROCESS, {...});
  if (inviteResponse.success) {
    welcomeMessage += '\n\nüéâ Invite code applied! Your friend earned 500 coins!';
  }
} catch (inviteError) {
  // Show warning but don't fail registration
  alert('‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid invite code: ' + (inviteError.message || 'Not found. Account created successfully.'));
}
```

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Payment Integration**: When integrating Stripe/payment processor, update paid tier flow to:
   - Collect payment before creating account
   - Handle payment failures gracefully
   - Store payment method for subscriptions

2. **Name Validation**: Consider adding:
   - Min/max length validation
   - Special character filtering
   - Profanity check for professional names

3. **Invite Code UI**: Consider:
   - Real-time validation as user types
   - Autocomplete for known invite codes
   - Visual indicator (‚úì/‚úó) next to invite field

4. **Error Messages**: Consider:
   - More specific error messages
   - Multi-language support
   - In-line field validation instead of alerts
