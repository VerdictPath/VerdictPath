# 🚂 Quick Railway Update Guide

## The Problem
Railway is running **old code** and doesn't have:
- ❌ Registration fixes (5 bugs)
- ❌ Coin farming protection
- ❌ Name input fields

## The Solution (Pick One)

### ⭐ Option 1: Reconnect GitHub (EASIEST)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your `verdictpath` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **GitHub**
4. Click **Disconnect**
5. Click **Connect** and select your repository
6. Railway will automatically redeploy
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

### 🔧 Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 📦 Option 3: Git Push (if auto-deploy enabled)
```bash
git push origin main
# Railway will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes
```

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After deployment, test this endpoint:
```bash
curl https://verdictpath.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic/daily-claim-check
```

**Expected result:**
```json
{
  "hasColumn": true,
  "message": "Daily claim protection is active"
}
```

If you see **"Cannot GET /api/diagnostic..."** = Railway still has old code

If you see **the JSON response** = ✅ Railway updated successfully!

## 🎯 After Update

All these will work in production:
- ✅ Users can enter real names
- ✅ Paid tier registration works
- ✅ Invite code errors show feedback
- ✅ Coin farming blocked
- ✅ Daily reward protection active
